title: Unsupervised machine learning for UsArrests.csv 
---
This project is designed to analyse the correlations between arrests in different states and build an unsupervised model separating states into groups with 
different crime rates. 

* The project shows correlation between arrests for murder, rape and assaults and the number of urbanized population in all states of US. 
* It is based on comma separated values file named UsArrests.csv attached to this repo. 
* It makes use of PCA(principal component analysis) to reduce the number of dimensions. 
* It uses hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering models to cluster states into different groups.

### Instalation
* download files connected to this project
* install anaconda on your machine from here https://www.anaconda.com/

* upload the files of interest to your jupyter notebook
* run notebook
* if any of the libraries not on your machine, go to command prompt and write command: pip install library
eg.for pandas you will have: pip install pandas

### Usage
Run the notebook to see how to scale, use principal component analysis and how to create models for unsupervised machine learning.
